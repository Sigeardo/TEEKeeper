**TEEKeeper** (_Temperature Environment Electronic Keeper_, or _TEEK_ for short) is an open source, Arduino based controller for high temperature electric ovens, such as heat treating ovens for metallurgy/bladesmithing, glass and ceramic kilns, etc.
In a broader sense, this projects aims to develop a platform that can be upgraded, expanded and extended by anyone, bringing more advanced control features to the users.

The principles behind this uni/passion project are:

**1) Open Source and DIY oriented design:**
     TEEK has been inspired by and made possible by many open source and DIY sources, in the forms of documentation, educational material, tools, software, designs etc.
     This project embraces these principles and aspires to give something back to these communities.

**2) Safety and Security:**
     Both in the design of the code and the circuits, developing methods & functions keeping in mind the potential risks for the user.

**3) Accessibility & ease of use:**
     The system may grow more and more complex, but the user must be presented with a simple, undestrandable and intuitive U/I.
     The code must be as readable as possible, to allow anyone to approach the codebase to make 

**5) It doesn't stop at the board:**
     Data logging and analysis tools can help to improve workflows and perform diagnostics checks. Give users data collection methods, statistics and tools.

**6) Be creative & don't be afraid of complexity!**
     But still, try to keep it simple - not trivial!
     
***DISCLAIMER: high temperature & electric related hazards are very real. 
Be aware of what you're doing and use this code at your own risk.***
