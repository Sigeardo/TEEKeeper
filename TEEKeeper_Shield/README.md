**TEEKeeper** (_Temperature Environment Electronic Keeper_, or _TEEK_ for short) is an open source, Arduino based controller for high temperature electric ovens, such as heat treating ovens for metallurgy/bladesmithing, glass and ceramic kilns, etc.
In a broader sense, this projects aims to develop a platform that can be upgraded, expanded and extended by anyone, bringing more advanced control features to the users.
